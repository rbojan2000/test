# weather-air-analytics

The **weather-air-analytics** project is an integrated platform designed for comprehensive analysis of air quality data. It encompasses various modules dedicated to different aspects of air quality analysis, including real-time data processing, batch data processing, and historical data retrieval.

- **Historical Data Retrieval**: For accessing historical air quality data, the [open-meteo](open-meteo/README.md) project provides tools and resources. Refer to its README for guidance on retrieving and processing historical air quality data.

- **Real-time Data Analysis**: This module, detailed in the [streams-insights](streams-insights/README.md) directory, focuses on analyzing real-time air quality data streams. For more information, please refer to the corresponding README.

- **Batch Data Analysis**: The [weather-air-insights](weather-air-insights/README.md) directory contains documentation and code related to batch data processing and analysis. This module is essential for in-depth analysis of historical air quality trends and patterns.

Each part of the project has its own README providing detailed information and instructions specific to its functionality and usage. Please refer to these individual README files for a deeper understanding of each module within the **weather-air-analytics** project.
