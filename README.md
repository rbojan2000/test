# Weather Air Analytics

The **Weather Air Analytics** project  is an integrated platform designed for comprehensive analysis of air quality data. It encompasses various modules dedicated to different aspects of air quality analysis, including real-time data processing, batch data processing, and historical data retrieval.


## Historical Data Retrieval

The [open-meteo](open-meteo/README.md) is responsible for retrieving historical air quality and weather forecast data.

## Real-time Data Analysis

The [streams-insights](streams-insights/README.md) focuses on analyzing real-time air quality data streams, calculating metrics, and monitoring city air pollution levels.

## Batch Data Analysis

The [air-meteo-insights](air-meteo-insights/README.md) focuses on batch data processing and weather and air quality analysis. This module is essential for in-depth analysis of historical air quality trends and patterns.

Each part of the project has its own README providing detailed information and instructions specific to its functionality and usage. Please refer to these individual README files for a deeper understanding of each module within the **Weather Air Analytics** project.

## Architecture
